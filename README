Bamboo plugin for CxSAST scanning
=================================


BUILD
-----
1. Set up the Atlassian Plugin SDK,
   https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project
2. From the plugin root, issue the atlas-run command


INSTALL
-------
1. Stop Bamboo
2. Copy the .jar file to the Bamboo WEB-INF/lib folder on the Bamboo master server.
   Example: /opt/atlassian-bamboo-5.12.4/atlassian-bamboo/WEB-INF/lib
3. Remove any previous versions of the .jar file from this folder
4. Start Bamboo
5. Make sure the plugin is enabled under Bamboo administration -> Manage add-ons


CONFIGURE
---------
1. As Administrator, go to Bamboo administration -> ADD-ONS (left panel) -> Checkmarx Plugin to configure the default Checkmarx server settings.
2. Server certificates are validated, so if HTTPS is used for the Checkmarx server communication then make sure the certificate CA is included in the local Java cacerts keystore.
3. Create a new Plan and enable it. Under the Default Job, add a Source Code Checkout Task and a Checkmarx Scan Task.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------
- To handle more than one source repository per Checkmarx Scan Task, all repositories must be checked out in the same Source Code Checkout Task, with the first repository checked out in a root folder and subsequent repositories in subfolders.
